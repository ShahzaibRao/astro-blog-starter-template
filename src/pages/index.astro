      <h1>🧑‍💻 Assalamualaikum! I'm Rao Shahzaib – DevOps Engineer</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my personal DevOps blog. Here I share real-world automation labs, Terraform scripts,
        and cloud infrastructure tutorials in <strong>simple Roman Urdu</strong> so students and learners can understand
        complex concepts easily.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work with tools like <strong>Terraform, Kubernetes (K3s), Oracle Cloud, AWS, Ansible</strong>, and
        more. My goal is to make DevOps approachable for everyone — especially for beginners who want practical,
        hands-on knowledge.

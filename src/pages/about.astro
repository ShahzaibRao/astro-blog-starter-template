    👋 Assalamualaikum! I'm <strong>Rao Shahzaib</strong> — a passionate DevOps Engineer who loves automating infrastructure,
    building cloud-native labs, and teaching DevOps in <strong>simple Roman Urdu</strong> so others can learn without stress.
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey started with traditional IT, but I quickly moved into the world of Infrastructure as Code (IaC),
    containers, and cloud. Over the years, I’ve gained solid experience in:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>🔧 <strong>Terraform</strong> – Building reusable infrastructure modules for AWS & Oracle Cloud (OCI)</li>
    <li>☸️ <strong>Kubernetes</strong> – Deploying lightweight K3s clusters on bare metal & cloud</li>
    <li>📦 <strong>Proxmox</strong> – Automating VM provisioning with Terraform & Ansible</li>
    <li>🚀 <strong>CI/CD</strong> – Setting up GitLab pipelines, deployments, and GitOps (minimal)</li>
    <li>📘 <strong>Teaching</strong> – Writing beginner-friendly tutorials & labs in Roman Urdu</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I’ve worked on real-world projects — like deploying multi-VM labs with Proxmox and Ansible, creating custom Kubernetes
    clusters on Oracle Cloud without relying on GitOps tools, and helping students grasp Terraform by explaining it in their
    local language.
  </p>

  <p>
    This blog is a space where I share my personal projects, bootcamp labs, and helpful guides for anyone diving into
    DevOps — whether you're a student or already in the industry.
  </p>

  <p>
    💬 **My Motto:** “Jo samjhay wohi sikhtay hain.” (Those who understand, learn better.)
    That’s why I try to explain even complex tech topics in plain, relatable ways.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I’m not writing scripts or setting up clusters, I’m helping others debug their YAML files, fix broken Terraform plans,
    or break down DevOps myths.
  </p>

    learning and sharing.

    Shukriya for visiting! 😊

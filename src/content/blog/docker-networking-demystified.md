*This post is part of the **Container Networking From Scratch** series — follow a packet's path through the Linux kernel, from namespaces to NAT.*

Your Docker container is not a virtual machine. It is isolation created by the Linux kernel using namespaces and cgroups. If you do not understand the networking underneath, debugging production issues becomes guesswork.

Many engineers can run a container, but when networking breaks, they restart services instead of tracing the packet path. This guide removes the abstraction and shows what is happening inside the kernel.

We will use:

* Ubuntu 24.04
* Docker Engine
* Linux tools: `ip`, `bridge`, `iptables`, `sysctl`

Every step includes terminal commands and example outputs so you can relate theory to reality.

# The Illusion of Connectivity

Docker networking solves one major problem:

How do you run many isolated processes on one host without port conflicts and traffic mixing?

If everything used the host network:

* You could not run two Nginx containers on port 80.
* Backend traffic would mix with public traffic.
* Services would conflict.

Docker uses three Linux kernel features:

1. Network Namespaces
2. Virtual Ethernet (veth) pairs
3. Linux Bridge

These are not Docker inventions. They are standard Linux features. Docker simply automates wiring them together.

---

# Production Lab Setup

We are working on a clean Ubuntu 24.04 server.

Check system info:

```bash
$ uname -a
Linux ubuntu 6.8.0-xx-generic #xx-Ubuntu SMP x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

Check Docker version:

```bash
$ docker version
Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           26.x.x
```

Check current network interfaces before starting containers:

```bash
$ ip -br addr
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
eth0             UP             192.168.1.10/24 fe80::a00:27ff:fe4e:66a1/64
```

No docker bridge yet (if Docker service not started).

Start Docker:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start docker
```

Now check again:

```bash
$ ip -br addr
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
eth0             UP             192.168.1.10/24 fe80::a00:27ff:fe4e:66a1/64
docker0          DOWN           172.17.0.1/16
```

The `docker0` bridge is created automatically.

# Deconstructing the Container Network

Start two Nginx containers:

```bash
$ sudo docker run -d --name ng1 nginx
a1b2c3d4e5f6...

$ sudo docker run -d --name ng2 nginx
f6e5d4c3b2a1...
```

List running containers:

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE    NAME
a1b2c3d4e5f6   nginx    ng1
f6e5d4c3b2a1   nginx    ng2
```

---

## What Changed on the Host?

Check interfaces:

```bash
$ ip link
...
4: docker0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> ...
6: veth7abc123@if5: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> ...
7: veth8def456@if6: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> ...
```

What are these?

* `docker0` → Linux bridge (virtual switch)
* `vethXXXX` → One end of virtual ethernet cable

Each container gets one veth pair.

---

# Entering the Container Network Namespace

Docker hides namespaces from `ip netns`, but they exist.

Get container PID:

```bash
$ docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' ng1
12345
```

Link its namespace:

```bash
$ sudo ln -s /proc/12345/ns/net /var/run/netns/ng1
```

Now inspect inside:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ng1 ip -br addr
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
eth0@if6         UP             172.17.0.2/16 fe80::42:acff:fe11:2/64
```

Inside the container:

* `eth0` has private IP (172.17.0.2)
* It connects to a veth interface on the host

This is how packets move:

Container eth0 → veth pair → docker0 bridge → host routing

It is memory-to-memory transfer inside the kernel.

---

# Understanding the Bridge

Inspect bridge:

```bash
$ bridge link
6: veth7abc123 state UP master docker0
7: veth8def456 state UP master docker0
```

This shows:

* Both containers connected to docker0
* docker0 acts like a switch

---

# The "Deleted Rule" Disaster

Docker relies heavily on iptables NAT rules.

List NAT table:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -L -n -v
Chain DOCKER (2 references)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source    destination
```

Flush Docker chain:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -F DOCKER
```

Now containers lose internet access.

Test inside container:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ng1 ping 8.8.8.8
connect: Network is unreachable
```

Containers are still running:

```bash
$ docker ps
ng1   nginx   Up 2 minutes
```

But networking is broken.

Senior engineers check counters:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -nvL
```

Before blaming application code.

# Deep Technical Explanation: Packet Forwarding Path

When container tries to reach 8.8.8.8:

Step 1: Packet leaves container

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ng1 ping 8.8.8.8
```

Step 2: Packet enters host via veth

Check routing table:

```bash
$ ip route
default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
172.17.0.0/16 dev docker0 proto kernel scope link src 172.17.0.1
```

Step 3: IP forwarding must be enabled

```bash
$ sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```

If it is 0:

```bash
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

Step 4: Masquerading (SNAT)

Check POSTROUTING:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING -n -v
MASQUERADE  all  --  172.17.0.0/16  anywhere
```

This rewrites:

Source: 172.17.0.2
To: 192.168.1.10

So replies return correctly.

---

# Inter-Container Isolation

Check bridge netfilter setting:

```bash
$ sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
```

This forces bridge traffic through iptables FORWARD chain.

If FORWARD policy is DROP:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
```

Containers stop talking to each other unless ACCEPT rule exists.

This is how Docker controls isolation.

---

# Real Production Problem: conntrack Table Full

Check conntrack limit:

```bash
$ sysctl net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max
net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max = 262144
```

Check current usage:

```bash
$ sudo cat /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_count
245000
```

If table fills up, kernel logs:

```bash
$ dmesg | grep conntrack
nf_conntrack: table full, dropping packet
```

Symptoms:

* Connection timeouts
* Random API failures
* CPU and memory look normal

Correct solution:

* Use connection pooling
* Reduce short-lived connections
* Tune limit carefully

Do not blindly increase the value.

---

# Security: DOCKER-USER Chain

List filter table:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -L -n -v
Chain DOCKER-USER (1 references)
```

This chain is processed before Docker rules.

Add custom firewall rule safely:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -I DOCKER-USER -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j DROP
```

Do not modify FORWARD directly. Docker may override it.

# Performance Optimization Insight

If two containers communicate heavily:

Instead of TCP over bridge:

* Use Unix Domain Socket via shared volume
* Or use AF_VSOCK

This bypasses:

* Bridge
* iptables
* TCP/IP overhead

Result: lower latency and higher throughput.

---

# Core Mental Model: Physical Patch Panel

Think physically, not logically.

Network Namespace → Locked room
VETH Pair → Ethernet cable
Bridge → Switch
iptables → Security guard

When container starts:

* Docker creates namespace
* Creates veth pair
* Connects to bridge
* Programs iptables rules

If any part fails:

* Cable unplugged → veth issue
* Switch broken → bridge issue
* Guard blocking → iptables issue

Packets stop moving.

---

# Conclusion

You now understand:

* How namespaces isolate networking
* How veth pairs connect container to host
* How docker0 acts as a switch
* How iptables performs NAT and filtering
* How conntrack can silently break production

When you understand the packet path, you can debug anything.

This is the difference between using Docker and mastering it.

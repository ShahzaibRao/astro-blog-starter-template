*This post is part of the **Container Networking From Scratch** series — follow a packet's path through the Linux kernel, from namespaces to NAT.*

Most DevOps engineers think containers reach the internet automatically. In reality, **SNAT (Source Network Address Translation)** inside the Linux kernel is doing the real work.

If someone flushes your iptables NAT table, your containers immediately lose internet access. At that moment, YAML files will not save you. You must understand Netfilter.

This guide shows:

* How Docker uses SNAT
* What MASQUERADE actually does
* How to build SNAT manually
* Why static SNAT is better in production
* How conntrack controls everything

All steps include real commands and example outputs.

# The Bridge Between Private and Public

By default, Docker assigns container IPs like:

```
172.17.0.2
172.17.0.3
```

These are private IPs. They work inside the host.

But the internet does not route private addresses.

If a container sends traffic like this:

```
172.17.0.2 → 8.8.8.8
```

The reply will never come back.

SNAT solves this by:

* Replacing the source IP with the host’s public IP
* Recording the translation in conntrack
* Reversing the translation when the reply arrives

This is how:

* `docker pull`
* API calls
* External database connections

all work.

# Production Lab Environment

Environment:

* Ubuntu 24.04
* Docker installed
* One Nginx container
* Default `docker0` bridge
* Host interface `eth0`

---

# Step 1: Start Container

```bash
$ sudo docker run -d --name web nginx
d3adb33f1234...
```

Check container IP:

```bash
$ docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' web
172.17.0.2
```

Check host interfaces:

```bash
$ ip -br addr
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
eth0             UP             192.168.1.10/24
docker0          UP             172.17.0.1/16
```

---

# Step 2: Check Default Docker NAT Rule

List NAT rules:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -S
```

Example output:

```
-A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.0.0/16 ! -o docker0 -j MASQUERADE
```

This means:

For traffic from container subnet leaving the host
→ Replace source IP with host interface IP

This is SNAT using MASQUERADE.

---

# Step 3: Break It (Simulate Production Disaster)

Flush NAT table:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -F
```

Now test from container:

```bash
$ sudo docker exec web ping -c 2 8.8.8.8
connect: Network is unreachable
```

Run tcpdump on host:

```bash
$ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 icmp
```

You may see:

```
IP 172.17.0.2 > 8.8.8.8: ICMP echo request
```

Packet leaves with private IP.
Internet cannot reply.

SNAT is gone.

---

# Step 4: Add Manual MASQUERADE Rule

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.0.0/16 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```

Check rule:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING -n -v
Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source
    0     0 MASQUERADE  all  --  *      eth0   172.17.0.0/16
```

Test again:

```bash
$ sudo docker exec web ping -c 2 8.8.8.8
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=117 time=18 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=117 time=17 ms
```

It works immediately.

The kernel is now rewriting packets.

---

# What MASQUERADE Actually Does

When packet reaches `POSTROUTING`:

Original packet:

```
Source: 172.17.0.2
Destination: 8.8.8.8
```

After MASQUERADE:

```
Source: 192.168.1.10
Destination: 8.8.8.8
```

Reply arrives:

```
Destination: 192.168.1.10
```

Kernel checks conntrack table and rewrites:

```
Destination: 172.17.0.2
```

Then forwards to container.

---

# View Live conntrack Table

Install tool if needed:

```bash
$ sudo apt install conntrack
```

Check entries:

```bash
$ sudo conntrack -L
```

Example:

```
icmp     1 29 src=172.17.0.2 dst=8.8.8.8 type=8 code=0
         src=8.8.8.8 dst=192.168.1.10 type=0 code=0
```

This shows:

Original direction:

```
172.17.0.2 → 8.8.8.8
```

Reply direction:

```
8.8.8.8 → 192.168.1.10
```

conntrack links them together.

If this table fills up, NAT stops working.

# MASQUERADE vs Static SNAT

## MASQUERADE

Rule example:

```bash
-j MASQUERADE
```

Characteristics:

* Automatically uses outgoing interface IP
* Good for dynamic IP (DHCP)
* Flushes connections if interface goes down
* Slightly more CPU overhead

---

## Static SNAT

Rule example:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.0.0/16 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.1.10
```

Characteristics:

* Hard-coded public IP
* Faster
* Better for production servers
* Required for IP whitelisting

Use static SNAT when:

* Public IP is fixed
* External services require exact source IP

---

# Production Oversight: Wrong IP Whitelisted

Problem:

* External banking API whitelists `203.0.113.10`
* Host has multiple IPs
* MASQUERADE chooses different source IP

Result:

* Random 403 errors
* Looks like authentication problem
* Actually routing problem

Fix:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.0.0/16 -j SNAT --to-source 203.0.113.10
```

Now container always exits with correct IP.

---

# IP Spoofing Risk

SNAT rewrites source IP after FORWARD chain.

If attacker spoofs packet inside container:

```
Source: 1.2.3.4
```

Without proper filtering, SNAT may rewrite and allow it out.

Solution:

Add strict FORWARD filtering:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 172.17.0.5 ! -i docker0 -j DROP
```

Ensure container can only send traffic from its real IP.

---

# Port Range Limiting

Prevent one container from exhausting ports:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.0.0/16 \
  -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.1.10:10000-20000
```

Limits NAT source ports to specific range.

---

# Monitor conntrack Usage

Check current usage:

```bash
$ sysctl net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_count
```

Check max limit:

```bash
$ sysctl net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max
```

If count approaches max:

* You have connection leak
* Or short-lived connection storm
* Or DDoS attempt

---

# Bypass NAT for Internal Traffic

Avoid unnecessary NAT inside VPC:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d 10.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
```

This prevents NAT for internal subnet.

Saves CPU and reduces conntrack usage.

---

# Mental Model: The Return Envelope

Container = Employee desk
Private IP = Desk number
Public IP = Company address
NAT table = Mailroom logbook

When sending mail:

1. Clerk replaces desk number with company address
2. Writes secret tracking code
3. Sends letter

When reply arrives:

1. Clerk checks logbook
2. Restores desk number
3. Delivers mail

If logbook is erased (iptables flush):

* Replies arrive
* Nobody knows who they belong to
* Packets are dropped

---

# Conclusion

You now understand:

* Why containers cannot reach internet without SNAT
* How MASQUERADE works internally
* Why static SNAT is better for production
* How conntrack maintains state
* Why flushing iptables breaks everything
* How to harden and optimize egress traffic

SNAT is not magic.
It is a stateful kernel translation process.

When you understand the translation engine, you control container egress completely.

If you are debugging a production networking issue, start by checking:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -L -n -v
$ sudo conntrack -L
$ sysctl net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_count
```

The problem is usually there.

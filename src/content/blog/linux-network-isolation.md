*This post is part of the **Container Networking From Scratch** series — follow a packet's path through the Linux kernel, from namespaces to NAT.*

Most DevOps engineers use containers every day without truly understanding how the Linux kernel isolates networking. If you cannot explain exactly how a packet leaves a container and reaches the physical network interface, you are guessing when production networking fails.

This guide removes Docker and Kubernetes from the picture and builds everything directly using Linux primitives.

# The Illusion of the Container

There is no such thing as a "container" inside the Linux kernel.

A container is simply a combination of isolation features. The most important one for networking is the **Network Namespace**.

When you run a microservice, it appears to have:

* Its own IP address
* Its own routing table
* Its own firewall rules
* Its own network interfaces

This is not magic. It is a logical partition of the kernel network stack.

Without network namespaces:

* Every process would compete for port 80 or 443
* You could not run multiple web servers on one machine
* One misconfigured process could sniff all host traffic

Network namespaces virtualize the entire network stack.

Each namespace gets:

* Its own `lo` interface
* Its own `eth0`
* Its own routing table
* Its own iptables rules

But isolation creates a problem:

If a process is fully isolated, it has no connection to the outside world.

To solve this, Linux provides a virtual cable called a **VETH pair**.

# Setting Up the Laboratory

We will use a clean Ubuntu 24.04 system.

Install required tools:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y iproute2 tcpdump bridge-utils
```

Verify:

```bash
$ ip -V
ip utility, iproute2-6.x.x

$ tcpdump --version
tcpdump version 4.x.x
```

We are now ready to build networking manually.

---

# Building the Network From Scratch

## Step 1 — Create a Namespace

Create namespace `ns1`:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns add ns1
```

Verify:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns list
ns1
```

Internally, the kernel creates:

```
/var/run/netns/ns1
```

---

## Step 2 — Inspect the Empty Namespace

Run inside namespace:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link
```

Output:

```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK> mtu 65536 state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default
```

Notice:

* Only loopback exists
* It is DOWN
* No `eth0`
* No IP addresses

Check addresses:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip -br addr
```

Output:

```
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
```

Try internet:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
```

Output:

```
connect: Network is unreachable
```

This namespace is completely isolated.

---

# Creating the Virtual Cable (VETH Pair)

Create VETH pair:

```bash
$ sudo ip link add veth1 type veth peer name veth2
```

Check on host:

```bash
$ ip -br link
```

Example:

```
lo               UNKNOWN
eth0             UP
veth1@veth2      DOWN
veth2@veth1      DOWN
```

Explanation:

* This is one virtual cable.
* `veth1` is connected to `veth2`.
* The `@` symbol shows the peer.

At this moment, both ends live in the host namespace.

---

# Moving One End into the Namespace

Move `veth2` into `ns1`:

```bash
$ sudo ip link set veth2 netns ns1
```

Now check host:

```bash
$ ip -br link
```

Output:

```
lo               UNKNOWN
eth0             UP
veth1@if12       DOWN
```

Notice:

* `veth2` disappeared
* Now shown as `veth1@if12`

---

# The Ghost in the Machine: ifindex

Each interface has a unique ID called `ifindex`.

Check detailed output:

```bash
$ ip link show veth1
```

Example:

```
7: veth1@if12: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 state DOWN mode DEFAULT
```

When the peer is in another namespace:

* Linux hides its name
* But keeps the interface index

In production debugging, you match these index numbers to find which container owns which veth pair.

---

# Activating the Data Path

A cable alone is not enough.

We need:

* Interfaces UP
* IP addresses assigned

---

## Configure Inside ns1

Rename interface:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link set veth2 name eth1000
```

Bring loopback up:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link set lo up
```

Bring interface up:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link set eth1000 up
```

Assign IP:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip addr add 10.66.77.24/24 dev eth1000
```

Verify:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip -br addr
```

Output:

```
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
eth1000          UP             10.66.77.24/24
```

---

## Configure Host Side

Bring up:

```bash
$ sudo ip link set veth1 up
```

Assign IP:

```bash
$ sudo ip addr add 10.66.77.25/24 dev veth1
```

Verify:

```bash
$ ip -br addr
```

Example:

```
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
eth0             UP             192.168.1.10/24
veth1            UP             10.66.77.25/24
```

---

# Proving Packet Flow

Open terminal 1:

```bash
$ sudo tcpdump -i veth1 icmp
```

Open terminal 2:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ping 10.66.77.25
```

tcpdump output:

```
IP 10.66.77.24 > 10.66.77.25: ICMP echo request
IP 10.66.77.25 > 10.66.77.24: ICMP echo reply
```

What happened internally:

1. Packet generated in namespace
2. Routed to `eth1000`
3. Enters VETH driver
4. Kernel copies packet to `veth1`
5. Host receives it

This is the exact mechanism Docker relies on.

---

# Creating Two Isolated Worlds

Create second namespace:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns add ns2
```

You can create another VETH pair and move each side into different namespaces.

Now two isolated environments communicate directly, while the host only stores the packet in kernel memory.

---

# The Docker Disconnect

On a Docker host:

```bash
$ ip netns list
```

Usually shows nothing.

Docker stores namespaces in:

```
/var/run/docker/netns/
```

The `ip netns` command checks:

```
/var/run/netns/
```

To inspect Docker namespaces manually, you must create symbolic links.

Docker hides them to control lifecycle management.

---

# Production Reality: Star Topology

In real environments:

* Host creates a Linux bridge (example: `docker0`)
* Each container VETH connects to that bridge

Check:

```bash
$ ip link show docker0
```

Example:

```
3: docker0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 state UP
```

This forms a star topology.

---

# Performance Considerations

VETH is fast because:

* It is memory-to-memory copy inside kernel

But:

* Every namespace crossing re-enters the network stack
* Adds latency
* Adds ARP entries
* Adds routing entries

Check neighbor table:

```bash
$ ip neigh | wc -l
```

In large Kubernetes nodes, you may see:

```
No buffer space available
```

This means kernel tables are exhausted.

---

# Hardening the Stack

Namespace isolation means:

* Cannot see host interfaces
* Cannot sniff other container traffic

But kernel and hardware are still shared.

Check firewall rules inside namespace:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 iptables -L
```

Security must exist:

* Inside namespace
* On host

Isolation is not full virtualization.

---

# Core Mental Model

Think of:

Network Namespace = private network configuration inside kernel memory
VETH pair = pipe between namespaces

When you run:

```bash
$ ping 10.66.77.25
```

The kernel:

1. Reads routing table in current namespace
2. Sends packet into VETH
3. Immediately delivers to peer
4. Processes packet in other namespace

This is how containers work internally.

---

# Cleanup

Delete namespace:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns delete ns1
$ sudo ip netns delete ns2
```

Delete interfaces if needed:

```bash
$ sudo ip link delete veth1
```

Verify:

```bash
$ ip netns list
```

No output means cleanup successful.

# Conclusion

You manually built:

* Network namespaces
* VETH pairs
* IP routing
* Packet tracing

This is the foundation of:

* Docker networking
* Kubernetes networking
* Container isolation

When networking fails in production, understanding these primitives allows you to debug at the kernel level instead of restarting services blindly.

If you master this mental model, you stop being dependent on tools and start understanding how Linux actually moves packets.

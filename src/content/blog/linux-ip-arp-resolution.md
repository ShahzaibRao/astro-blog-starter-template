*This post is part of the **Container Networking From Scratch** series — follow a packet's path through the Linux kernel, from namespaces to NAT.*

Most DevOps engineers understand IP addresses. Very few understand how the Linux kernel actually resolves an IP address into a MAC address inside a virtualized container environment.

If you cannot clearly explain how Layer 3 (IP) becomes Layer 2 (MAC), you are guessing when container networking breaks.

This guide demonstrates the full ARP resolution process using Linux Network Namespaces and VETH pairs — exactly the same primitives used by Docker and Kubernetes.

# The Bridge Between Layers

When you send traffic in a cloud-native system, you think in terms of IP addresses.

But Ethernet does not deliver packets using IP addresses.

At **Layer 2**, communication happens using **MAC addresses**.

This creates a problem:

* Applications send packets to an IP.
* Network interfaces transmit frames to a MAC.

The protocol that bridges this gap is:

**ARP — Address Resolution Protocol**

ARP maps:

```
IPv4 Address  →  MAC Address
```

Without ARP:

* The packet reaches the interface
* But the interface does not know which neighboring machine owns the destination IP
* The frame cannot be delivered

In container environments where interfaces are constantly created and destroyed, ARP resolution is critical.

# Building the Virtual Lab

We will simulate two hosts on the same Layer 2 network using namespaces.

Environment:

* Ubuntu 24.04
* iproute2
* tcpdump

Install tools:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y iproute2 tcpdump
```

---

# Constructing the Network Path

## Step 1 — Create Two Isolated Namespaces

```bash
$ sudo ip netns add ns1
$ sudo ip netns add ns2
```

Verify:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns list
ns1
ns2
```

At this moment:

* Both namespaces are empty
* Only loopback exists
* No connectivity between them

---

## Step 2 — Create the Virtual Cable

Create a VETH pair:

```bash
$ sudo ip link add veth1 type veth peer name veth2
```

Check on host:

```bash
$ ip -br link
```

Example output:

```
lo               UNKNOWN
eth0             UP
veth1@veth2      DOWN
veth2@veth1      DOWN
```

This is a virtual patch cable with two ends.

---

## Step 3 — Plug Each End Into a Namespace

Move interfaces:

```bash
$ sudo ip link set veth1 netns ns1
$ sudo ip link set veth2 netns ns2
```

Rename them to `eth0` for realism:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link set veth1 name eth0
$ sudo ip netns exec ns2 ip link set veth2 name eth0
```

---

## Step 4 — Assign IP Addresses

Inside ns1:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip addr add 10.22.33.1/24 dev eth0
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link set eth0 up
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link set lo up
```

Inside ns2:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns2 ip addr add 10.22.33.55/24 dev eth0
$ sudo ip netns exec ns2 ip link set eth0 up
$ sudo ip netns exec ns2 ip link set lo up
```

Verify in ns1:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip -br addr
```

Output:

```
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
eth0             UP             10.22.33.1/24
```

Verify in ns2:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns2 ip -br addr
```

Output:

```
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
eth0             UP             10.22.33.55/24
```

We now have a functional Layer 2 network.

# Inspecting the ARP Table (Neighbor Cache)

Inside ns1:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip neigh show
```

Output:

```
<empty>
```

The kernel has no MAC address mapping for 10.22.33.55.

This means the first ping will trigger ARP.

---

# Watching ARP in Real Time

Start tcpdump inside ns1:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 tcpdump -i eth0 -n arp or icmp
```

Open another terminal and run:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ping -c 2 10.22.33.55
```

You will observe something like:

```
ARP, Request who-has 10.22.33.55 tell 10.22.33.1
ARP, Reply 10.22.33.55 is-at 8a:3b:12:44:aa:91
IP 10.22.33.1 > 10.22.33.55: ICMP echo request
IP 10.22.33.55 > 10.22.33.1: ICMP echo reply
```

This proves:

* Kernel did not know MAC
* Broadcasted ARP request
* Received unicast reply
* Updated neighbor table
* Sent ICMP packet

---

# Deep Dive: The Four-Step Resolution

When you run:

```bash
$ ping 10.22.33.55
```

The kernel performs:

### 1. Table Lookup

Checks ARP cache:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip neigh show
```

If entry exists, it sends packet immediately.

---

### 2. Broadcast Request

If entry missing:

* Kernel pauses ICMP packet
* Sends broadcast to:

```
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

Message:

```
Who has 10.22.33.55? Tell 10.22.33.1
```

---

### 3. Unicast Reply

Only ns2 responds:

```
10.22.33.55 is-at 8a:3b:12:44:aa:91
```

Sent directly back to requester.

---

### 4. Table Update

Check neighbor table again:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip neigh show
```

Now you will see:

```
10.22.33.55 dev eth0 lladdr 8a:3b:12:44:aa:91 REACHABLE
```

The kernel now has a valid Layer 2 mapping.

# The ARP Cache Poisoning of Productivity

In high-churn environments like Kubernetes:

* Pod A uses IP 10.22.33.55
* Pod A dies
* Pod B gets same IP

If ARP cache is stale:

* Traffic goes to old MAC
* Packets disappear
* You see "Destination Host Unreachable"

Always check:

```bash
$ ip neigh
```

If needed, clear entry:

```bash
$ sudo ip neigh flush all
```

---

# Production Traffic and ARP Storms

ARP uses broadcast.

In large flat networks:

* Every broadcast hits every interface
* CPU must process each broadcast
* High softirq usage may appear

Check softirq:

```bash
$ cat /proc/softirqs
```

ARP storms happen when:

* Interfaces flap
* Massive container churn
* Large Layer 2 domains

Solutions include:

* L3 segmentation
* ARP proxy
* Limiting broadcast domains

---

# Hardening the Data Link Layer

ARP has no authentication.

An attacker can send:

```
10.22.33.1 is-at attacker-mac
```

This is ARP Spoofing.

Mitigations:

* Static ARP entries (small scale)
* Dynamic ARP Inspection (switch-level)
* Monitor neighbor table changes

Monitor:

```bash
$ watch -n 1 ip neigh
```

Unexpected MAC changes are red flags.

---

# Mental Model: The Address Book

Think of ARP as an address book.

IP = Person's name
MAC = Physical street address

Broadcast = Shouting in a room
Unicast reply = Person handing you business card

ARP cache = Pocket storing that card

Once stored, kernel stops shouting until entry expires.

---

# Conclusion

We demonstrated:

* How IP resolves to MAC
* How ARP broadcasts work
* How neighbor tables update
* Why stale ARP breaks clusters
* Why ARP storms affect performance
* Why ARP spoofing is dangerous

By simulating this using namespaces and VETH pairs, we reproduced exactly how containers communicate on a host.

Understanding this Layer 3 to Layer 2 transition is what allows you to debug real production "unreachable" errors with confidence instead of guessing.

If you master this, container networking stops being mysterious and becomes predictable.

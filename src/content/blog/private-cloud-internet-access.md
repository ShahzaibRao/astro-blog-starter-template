*This post is part of the **Container Networking From Scratch** series — follow a packet's path through the Linux kernel, from namespaces to NAT.*

## The NAT and PAT Mystery

Most DevOps engineers can configure a VPC, but when packets get dropped at the edge, they don’t know why. If you don’t understand how the Linux kernel performs address translation, you are one routing mistake away from a production outage.

This guide explains NAT and PAT using a real Linux lab with commands and outputs so you can see exactly what is happening.

# The Translator of the Modern Network

IPv4 addresses are limited. NAT (Network Address Translation) allows:

* Thousands of private IPs
* To share one public IP

Without NAT:

If your container sends traffic from `10.22.33.2` to `8.8.8.8`, Google would try to reply to `10.22.33.2`. That IP is private and not routable on the internet. The reply would never return.

NAT solves the return path problem by rewriting packet headers.

In Linux, NAT is implemented using:

* IP forwarding
* Netfilter framework
* iptables `nat` table
* conntrack (connection tracking)

---

# Building the Connectivity Lab

We will simulate a private container using a network namespace.

## Lab Topology

* Namespace: `ns1`
* Private IP: `10.22.33.2/24`
* Bridge: `br0`
* Gateway IP: `10.22.33.1`
* Host WAN interface: `eth0`

---

# Step 1: Create Namespace

```bash
$ sudo ip netns add ns1
```

Verify:

```bash
$ ip netns list
ns1
```

---

# Step 2: Create veth Pair

This acts like a virtual cable.

```bash
$ sudo ip link add veth-ns type veth peer name veth-br
```

Move one side into namespace:

```bash
$ sudo ip link set veth-ns netns ns1
```

---

# Step 3: Create Bridge

```bash
$ sudo ip link add br0 type bridge
$ sudo ip addr add 10.22.33.1/24 dev br0
$ sudo ip link set br0 up
```

Attach veth to bridge:

```bash
$ sudo ip link set veth-br master br0
$ sudo ip link set veth-br up
```

---

# Step 4: Configure Namespace Interface

Inside namespace:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip addr add 10.22.33.2/24 dev veth-ns
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link set veth-ns up
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link set lo up
```

Set default route:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip route add default via 10.22.33.1
```

Check configuration:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip -br addr
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
veth-ns@if5      UP             10.22.33.2/24
```

---

# Step 5: Test Without NAT (It Will Fail)

Try pinging internet:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ping -c 2 8.8.8.8
connect: Network is unreachable
```

Why?

Because:

* IP forwarding is disabled
* No NAT rule exists

---

# Step 6: Enable IP Forwarding

Check status:

```bash
$ sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
```

Enable it:

```bash
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```

Now the host can forward packets between interfaces.

---

# Step 7: Add NAT (SNAT / MASQUERADE)

Add NAT rule:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.22.33.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```

This means:

Any packet from `10.22.33.0/24` going out `eth0`
→ Replace source IP with host's public IP

Check rule:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -L -n -v
Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source          destination
    0     0 MASQUERADE  all  --  *      eth0    10.22.33.0/24   0.0.0.0/0
```

---

# Step 8: Test Again (Now It Works)

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ping -c 2 8.8.8.8
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=117 time=18.4 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=117 time=17.9 ms
```

NAT is working.

---

# What Actually Happened to the Packet?

Let’s trace it step by step.

## Inside Namespace

Source:

```
10.22.33.2 → 8.8.8.8
```

## On Host Before NAT

Packet reaches `br0`.

Kernel decides to forward via `eth0`.

## POSTROUTING NAT

The `nat` table changes:

```
Source: 10.22.33.2
Becomes: 192.168.1.10 (host public IP)
```

Now Google sees:

```
192.168.1.10 → 8.8.8.8
```

Google replies to 192.168.1.10.

---

# The Role of conntrack

Check connection tracking:

```bash
$ sudo conntrack -L | grep 10.22.33.2
```

Example output:

```
icmp     1 29 src=10.22.33.2 dst=8.8.8.8 type=8 code=0
         src=8.8.8.8 dst=192.168.1.10 type=0 code=0
```

The kernel stores:

* Original source
* Translated source
* Return mapping

When reply arrives:

Destination changes from:

```
192.168.1.10
```

Back to:

```
10.22.33.2
```

And packet is forwarded to namespace.

---

# The One-Way Street Problem

NAT only works for outbound initiated traffic.

If someone on the internet tries:

```
telnet 192.168.1.10 5432
```

The host does not know:

Which internal IP should receive this?

There is no conntrack entry.

Packet is dropped.

This is why:

* Outbound works
* Inbound fails

To allow inbound, you need DNAT or port forwarding.

Example:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to 10.22.33.2:80
```

Now traffic hitting:

```
HostIP:8080
```

Is forwarded to:

```
10.22.33.2:80
```

---

# NAT vs PAT

## Standard NAT

1 private IP → 1 public IP

Does not scale.

## PAT (Port Address Translation)

Many private IPs → 1 public IP
Distinguished by source port.

Example:

```
10.22.33.2:50000 → 8.8.8.8:53
10.22.33.3:50001 → 8.8.8.8:53
```

Both become:

```
192.168.1.10:40001
192.168.1.10:40002
```

Port numbers keep sessions unique.

This is what Docker and cloud NAT gateways use.

# Real Production Issue: Port Exhaustion

One public IP supports about 65,000 source ports per destination.

If:

* 5000 pods
* All calling same payment API
* Many short-lived connections

You can exhaust ports.

Symptoms:

* Random connection timeouts
* Works after retry
* CPU looks normal

Check usage:

```bash
$ sudo cat /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_count
```

Fix:

* Use connection pooling
* Add more public IPs
* Scale NAT gateway

---

# Security and Optimization

## Egress Filtering

Block specific internal IPs:

```bash
$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 10.22.33.5 -j DROP
```

Prevents compromised container from exfiltrating data.

---

## NAT Gateway vs NAT Instance

Cloud NAT Gateway:

* Managed
* Scales automatically
* High availability

NAT Instance (Linux VM with iptables):

* Limited conntrack table
* Can crash under load
* Needs manual tuning

For production: use managed NAT gateway.

---

# Mental Model: The PO Box

Private Subnet = Apartment building
Internal IP = Apartment number
Public IP = Main lobby PO Box
NAT = Building manager

When tenant sends mail:

* Manager writes reference number
* Replaces return address with building address

When reply arrives:

* Manager checks logbook
* Delivers to correct apartment

If random mail arrives without reference:
It gets discarded.

That is how NAT works.

---

# Conclusion

You now understand:

* Why private IPs cannot reach internet without NAT
* How SNAT rewrites source IP
* How PAT uses ports to multiplex connections
* Why inbound traffic fails by default
* How conntrack maintains state
* Why port exhaustion causes production failures

NAT is not just IP rewriting.
It is a stateful translation engine inside the Linux kernel.

When you understand that engine, you can debug any egress problem in Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud VPC environments.

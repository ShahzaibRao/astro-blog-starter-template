*This post is part of the **Container Networking From Scratch** series — follow a packet's path through the Linux kernel, from namespaces to NAT.*

Most engineers think they understand routing until they connect two different subnets and packets disappear. This guide explains **exactly why Linux drops traffic**, especially in multi-subnet environments like Kubernetes.

We will:

* Build a multi-subnet lab using network namespaces
* Watch routing decisions in real time
* Break traffic on purpose
* Fix it properly
* Understand why `rp_filter` silently drops packets

Everything includes real terminal commands and expected outputs so you can follow along.

# The Traffic Controller of the Modern Cloud

In Kubernetes, VPCs, overlays, and CNIs, Linux is the router.

* Every worker node is a router
* Every pod has a routing table
* Every packet passes through the Linux kernel routing engine

When traffic fails, it is usually because of:

* Missing routes
* Disabled forwarding
* Reverse Path Filtering (`rp_filter`)
* ARP not resolving
* FIB validation failure

If you do not understand how the kernel validates traffic, debugging production networking becomes guesswork.

# Production Sandbox Setup

Environment:

* Ubuntu 24.04
* Vagrant VM
* 2 CPU
* 2GB RAM

We will build:

| Component  | Purpose                |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| ns1        | Subnet 10.22.33.0/24   |
| ns2        | Subnet 10.22.34.0/24   |
| br0        | Bridge connecting both |
| veth pairs | Virtual cables         |

Goal:

Make `10.22.33.1` talk to `10.22.34.1`

---

# Step 1: Create Namespaces

```bash
$ sudo ip netns add ns1
$ sudo ip netns add ns2
```

Verify:

```bash
$ ip netns list
ns1
ns2
```

---

# Step 2: Create a Bridge

```bash
$ sudo ip link add br0 type bridge
$ sudo ip link set br0 up
```

Check:

```bash
$ ip -br link show br0
br0             UP             7a:6f:aa:19:44:12 <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP>
```

---

# Step 3: Create VETH Pairs

These act like virtual cables.

```bash
$ sudo ip link add veth1 type veth peer name veth1-br
$ sudo ip link add veth2 type veth peer name veth2-br
```

Move one side into namespaces:

```bash
$ sudo ip link set veth1 netns ns1
$ sudo ip link set veth2 netns ns2
```

Attach bridge sides:

```bash
$ sudo ip link set veth1-br master br0
$ sudo ip link set veth2-br master br0
$ sudo ip link set veth1-br up
$ sudo ip link set veth2-br up
```

---

# Step 4: Configure IP Addresses

Inside ns1:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip addr add 10.22.33.1/24 dev veth1
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link set veth1 up
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link set lo up
```

Inside ns2:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns2 ip addr add 10.22.34.1/24 dev veth2
$ sudo ip netns exec ns2 ip link set veth2 up
$ sudo ip netns exec ns2 ip link set lo up
```

Verify:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip -br addr
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
veth1            UP             10.22.33.1/24
```

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns2 ip -br addr
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
veth2            UP             10.22.34.1/24
```

---

# Step 5: Test Connectivity (It Will Fail)

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ping 10.22.34.1
connect: Network is unreachable
```

Why?

Check routing table:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip route show
10.22.33.0/24 dev veth1 proto kernel scope link src 10.22.33.1
```

There is no route to `10.22.34.0/24`.

---

# Step 6: Add Direct Routes

Add route in ns1:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip route add 10.22.34.0/24 dev veth1
```

Add reverse route in ns2:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns2 ip route add 10.22.33.0/24 dev veth2
```

Verify:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip route show
10.22.33.0/24 dev veth1 proto kernel scope link src 10.22.33.1
10.22.34.0/24 dev veth1 scope link
```

---

# Step 7: Enable IP Forwarding

Linux does not forward packets by default.

Check:

```bash
$ sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
```

Enable:

```bash
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```

---

# Step 8: Still Not Working? Welcome to rp_filter

Try ping again:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ping 10.22.34.1
```

Sometimes it still fails.

Run tcpdump:

```bash
$ sudo tcpdump -i br0 arp
ARP, Request who-has 10.22.34.1 tell 10.22.33.1
ARP, Reply 10.22.34.1 is-at 2a:bc:11:9f:44:21
```

ARP reply arrives.

But kernel drops it silently.

Why?

---

# The Reverse Path Filter (rp_filter)

Check setting:

```bash
$ sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
```

Value meanings:

| Value | Mode     |
| ----- | -------- |
| 0     | Disabled |
| 1     | Strict   |
| 2     | Loose    |

In strict mode:

The kernel verifies:

"If I wanted to reach the source IP, would I use this same interface?"

If answer is no → packet dropped.

This check happens inside the kernel function:

```
__fib_validate_source()
```

Drop reason internally:

```
SKB_DROP_REASON_IP_RPFILTER
```

This is silent. No logs.

---

# Fix: Use Loose Mode

```bash
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=2
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 2
```

Try ping again:

```bash
$ sudo ip netns exec ns1 ping 10.22.34.1
PING 10.22.34.1 (10.22.34.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.22.34.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.095 ms
64 bytes from 10.22.34.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.082 ms
```

Now it works.

---

# What Actually Happened Inside the Kernel

When a packet arrives:

1. Kernel checks routing table (FIB lookup)
2. Ensures route type is unicast
3. Validates interface match (if rp_filter=1)
4. Drops silently if mismatch

This protects against IP spoofing.

But in container networks, it often breaks valid traffic.

---

# Real Kubernetes Production Failure

In clusters using:

* Calico
* Flannel
* Cilium

Symptoms:

* Some pods can communicate
* Others timeout
* No application logs show errors

Root cause often:

* Strict `rp_filter`
* Missing back-route
* Asymmetric routing

Fix:

* Set `net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=2`
* Ensure routes exist for every pod subnet
* Validate with:

```bash
$ ip route show table main
```

---

# Security and Optimization

## Keep Strict Mode On Gateways

On internet-facing machines:

```
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1
```

Prevents spoofing.

## Audit Routing Table Size

Large clusters may have thousands of routes.

Check:

```bash
$ ip route show | wc -l
```

Large tables increase CPU usage per packet.

## Always Check Forwarding

```bash
$ sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding
```

If 0 → machine will not route traffic.

---

# Mental Model: GPS + Security Guard

Routing Table = Map
ARP Table = House Address
rp_filter = Security Guard

If the guard thinks someone arrived through the wrong gate, he removes them silently.

For networking to work:

The Map and the Guard must agree.

# Final Summary

You learned:

* How to build multi-subnet namespaces
* Why traffic fails between subnets
* How to inspect routing tables
* Why `rp_filter` drops packets
* How to fix it safely
* How this affects Kubernetes CNIs

Routing is not just a table.

It is a validation engine inside the Linux kernel.

When you understand FIB lookup and Reverse Path Filtering, you stop guessing and start debugging like a real infrastructure engineer.
